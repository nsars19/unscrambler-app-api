# unscrambler-app-api

An Express api for a React user interface. This application is built around the unscrambler library (found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unscrambler)) that I made specifically for this app.

The user interface repo can be found [here](https://github.com/nsars19/unscrambler-app-ui), and seen live [here](https://nsars19.github.io/unscrambler-app-ui/).
